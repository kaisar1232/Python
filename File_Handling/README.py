#This File Contains Some Information About "File_Handling"

'''

2)Open The File
3)Read The File     (Here At The Time Of File Reading We Use "r" i.e File Opend In Read Mode)

**************************************************************************************************************************************
Here Some Problems With File "Write" Operation

1)if We Use The "w" Parameter Then It Will Overwrite Our Existing File
    i.e It Will Erase The Data From File And Overwrite The File 

2)But When We Use "a"Parameter Then It Will No Affect On Our File 
    i.e It Can Not Erase The Data From Existing File 
    And It Can Append The Data Into A Exsting File
